Download [Adinkra.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kstiffle/hello-world/master/Adinkra.m) by right (command) clicking and saving [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kstiffle/hello-world/master/Adinkra.m) and download [AdinkraTutorial.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kstiffle/hello-world/master/AdinkraTutorial.nb) by right (command) clicking and saving [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kstiffle/hello-world/master/AdinkraTutorial.nb). On MAC, you may have to delete a .txt extension from AdinkraTutorial.nb.

The tutorial [AdinkraTutorial.nb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kstiffle/hello-world/master/AdinkraTutorial.nb) shows in depth how to use many of the tools of the Adinkra.m package listed below on this page. 


**Intallation:** after downloading [Adinkra.m](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kstiffle/hello-world/master/Adinkra.m), install it via the File->Install menu in Mathematica.

 **If updated from an old version of Adinkra.m, you may have to delete the old package first. Run [DeleteAdinkra.nb]() to delete an existing Adinkra package** 
 
 The date of the latest build, in yymmdd format, can be called by running, for example

**About the Adinkra.m package**

The Adinkra.m package includes tools to

```markdown

1. Build 4D, N=1 SUSY transfromation laws in Majorana components
2. Reduce to 1D (0-brane reduction), generating L- and R-matrices for arbitrary d
3. Graph L- and R- adinkra matrices as an adinkra for GR(4,4) matrices
4. Allows the user to encode their own arbitrary GR(d,N) L- and R- adinkra matrices and check that the GR(d,N) algebra is satisfied
4. Calculate chi_0 and holoraumy of adinkra matrices for arbitrary GR(d,N)
5. Print out L, R, holoraumy matrices and closure relationship in an l(d/4) \times l(4) tensor product basis in symbolic form ready to be LaTexed by Mathematica's TeXForm command

```



The list of functions can be found by running
