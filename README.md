The Adinkra.m package includes tools to

```markdown

1. Build 4D, N=1 SUSY transfromation laws in Majorana components
2. Reduce to 1D (0-brane reduction), generating L- and R-matrices for arbitrary d
3. Graph L- and R- adinkra matrices as an adinkra for GR(4,4) matrices
4. Allows the user to encode their own arbitrary GR(d,N) L- and R- adinkra matrices and check that the GR(d,N) algebra is satisfied
4. Calculate chi_0 and holoraumy of adinkra matrices for arbitrary GR(d,N)
5. Print out L, R, holoraumy matrices and closure relationship in an l(d/4) \times l(4) tensor product basis in symbolic form ready to be LaTexed by Mathematica's TeXForm command

```

Intallation step

```markdown

Mathematica with "File->Install->Package".
